## How to Deploy database changes with Prisma Migrate

To apply pending migrations to development, staging, or testing environments, run the `migrate deploy` command as part of your CI/CD pipeline:

```terminal
prisma migrate deploy
```

Exactly when to run `prisma migrate deploy` depends on your platform. For example, a simplified [Heroku](deploying-to-heroku) workflow includes:

1. Ensuring the `./prisma/migration` folder is in source control
2. Running `prisma migrate deploy` during the [release phase](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/release-phase)

Ideally, `migrate deploy` should be part of an automated CI/CD pipeline, and we do not generally recommend running this command locally to deploy changes to a production database (for example, by temporarily changing the `DATABASE_URL` environment variable). It is not genreally considered good practice to store the production database URL locally.

Beware that in order to run the `prisma migrate deploy` command, you need access the `prisma` dependency that is typically added to the `devDependencies`. Some platforms like Vercel, prune development dependencies during the build, thereby preventing you from calling the command. This can be worked around by making the `prisma` a production dependency, by moving it to `dependencies` in your `package.json`.

## Query engine binary and deployment

Prisma Client depends on the [query engine](../../../concepts/components/prisma-client/query-engine) that is running as a binary on the same host as your application.

The query engine is implemented in Rust and is used by Prisma in the form of executable binary files. The binary is downloaded when `prisma generate` is called. If the call happens on a different environment when deploying your Prisma-based application to production, you need to ensure that the `binaryTarget` in the Prisma schema is compatible with your production environment as described in [binary targets](/reference/api-reference/prisma-schema-reference#binarytargets-options).
